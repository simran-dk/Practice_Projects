# Data Analytics & Visualization Projects

This repository contains a collection of personal projects focused on data analysis, visualization, and exploratory insights using Python.

The projects are primarily hands-on exercises built to deepen my understanding of:
- Data manipulation and aggregation
- Visual analytics and charting
- Geospatial analysis using hex-based indexing (H3)
- Interactive mapping and spatial visualization

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- H3
- folium

## Project Themes
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Time-based and categorical analysis
- Spatial aggregation and hotspot detection
- Visual storytelling with data

## Notes
These projects are exploratory in nature and emphasize learning, experimentation, and clear analytical reasoning over production-ready code.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and scripts to see the analytical approach and visualizations.
